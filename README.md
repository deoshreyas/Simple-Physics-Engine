# Simple-Physics-Engine

## :zap: About
This is a very simple, *unoptimized* engine built using Python and Pygame as an experiment with [Verlet Integration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verlet_integration). Currently, it can only be used to simulate basic physics collisions.

Please note, the current implementation *might* lag slightly as the algorithm is not very well optimized.

## :desktop_computer: How to run locally
Just clone the repository on your machine, and run `main.py`. You might need to install a few packages, like `pygame`.

Please feel free to raise issues or give me your suggestions!
